# Pumpkin ðŸŽƒ

This application generates a test report directly from your gherkin feature files, so that your scenarios can be used as tests without the need for automation with Cucumber. If you have already automated some of your scenarios, the script accepts a Cucumber report (JSON) and it will pre-select the pass/fail status of those implemented scenarios so that you can fill in the rest manually.

## Installation

    $ npm install @padigital/pumpkin

## Usage

Run the script as follows:

    $ pumpkin --features /path/to/your/features/directory

The script accepts the following arguments:

- `--features` is the path to a local directory of gherkin feature files
- `--cucumberjson` is the path to a local JSON file containing a Cucumber test report (optional)
- `--reporthtml` is the path to a previous pumpkin HTML report (optional)
- `--open` to open the HTML report in your browser after the script completes (optional)
- `--title` to set the report title (optional)
- `--date` to set the report date/time (optional)
- `--notes` to set the report notes (optional)
- `--exclude` a space-separated list of tags to exclude e.g. "@wip @regression" (optional)

### Saving your results

Pumpkin generates a single HTML file inside which you record the status of each scenario (Descoped, In Progress, Passed, Failed or Blocked). You can set the status for every scenario within a feature, or set each scenario individually. When you're finished, or you want to save your work, click the "Save HTML" button at the top. Your browser will download a new HTML file containing all of your changes. Open this file and carry on making further changes in the future.

The best way to share the report is to generate a PDF by printing it. Pumpkin has a print stylesheet that will create a nice, clean, client-friendly report.

Select the `Print scenario steps` checkbox if you wish to display individual step detail (pdf only) or leave it un-checked to display only feature & scenario detail.

### Altering the order of features

By default the features will appear in the report in the same order that the files are ordered on your computer (alphabetically). To override this order use the `@report-order-N` tag on each feature. Tagged features will appear first, then the others ordered alphabetically. For example:

    @report-order-1
    Feature: Login
    ...

    @report-order-2
    Feature: Registration
    ...

### Pre-populating scenario status from a Cucumber report

If you pass the path to a Cucumber test run output (--cucumberjson) the script will attempt to find the pass/fail status from this file by matching the feature and scenario names.

    $ pumpkin --features /path/to/your/features/directory --cucumberjson /path/to/your/report.json

### Automatically opening the generated report

If you pass the open argument (--open) the script will automatically open the html report in the default browser.

    $ pumpkin --features /path/to/your/features/directory --open

### Excluding features or scenarios from the HTML report by their tags

If you passÂ a space-separated list of tags (--exclude), it will not include features or scenarios that have those tags in the generated html report. For example:

    $ pumpkin --features /path/to/your/features/directoryÂ --excludeÂ '@e2eÂ @smoke'

### Pre-populating scenario status from a previous HTML report

If you pass the path to a previous HTML report generated by this script (--reporthtml), it will attempt to find the scenario status by matching the scenario name. For example:

    $ pumpkin --features /path/to/your/features/directory --reporthtml /path/to/another/report.html
